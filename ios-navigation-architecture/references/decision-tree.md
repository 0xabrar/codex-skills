# Navigation Decision Tree

## Top-Level Structure
- Use tabs when there are 3-5 core sections used frequently.
- Use a single stack when the app is focused on one primary flow.

## Depth and Detail
- Use stack pushes for drill-down content.
- Keep depth shallow; avoid stacks deeper than 4-5 levels.

## Temporary Tasks
- Use modals for short, self-contained tasks.
- Use sheets for quick edits or filters that should not replace context.

## iPad Considerations
- Use split view patterns when side-by-side context improves tasks.

## Deep Links
- Map deep links into the correct stack path and avoid breaking the back stack.
