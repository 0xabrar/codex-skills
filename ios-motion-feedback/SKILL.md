# iOS Motion and Feedback

## Overview
Define motion and haptic feedback patterns that feel native and restrained.

## Inputs to Request
- Interaction type (navigation, state change, confirmation).
- Target devices (iPhone, iPad, or both).
- Any performance constraints.

## Workflow
1. Use the timing guidance in `references/timing.md`.
2. Apply the motion rules in `references/rules.md`.
3. Recommend haptic feedback only where it confirms action.

## Output Format
- Recommended animation type and timing.
- Haptic usage guidance.
- Risks or when to avoid motion.

## References
- `references/timing.md`
- `references/rules.md`
