# Motion and Haptics Rules

## Motion
- Use motion to explain state changes, not to decorate.
- Keep easing subtle; avoid springy or playful motion unless brand calls for it.
- Respect reduced motion settings and provide a static alternative.

## Haptics
- Use haptics for confirmations (success, toggle on/off, send).
- Avoid haptics for passive events or repeated background updates.
- Keep intensity low for frequent actions.
