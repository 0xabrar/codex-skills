# iOS HIG Basics Checklist

## Layout
- Root is scrollable when content can overflow.
- Safe areas are respected on top and bottom.
- Spacing uses a consistent rhythm (8/12/16/24).
- Content aligns to a clear grid and margins are consistent.

## Touch Targets
- All interactive elements meet 44x44pt minimum.
- Primary action is visually prominent.
- Destructive actions are clearly separated and labeled.

## Typography
- System text styles are used for hierarchy.
- Dynamic Type is supported (no fixed sizes that break).
- Line lengths are comfortable to scan.

## Color and Contrast
- Semantic system colors are used where possible.
- Contrast is sufficient for normal and large text.
- State is not encoded by color alone.

## Controls and Inputs
- Native controls are preferred over custom replicas.
- Form fields have clear labels and error messaging.

## Iconography
- SF Symbols are used for common actions.
- Icon-only actions have accessible labels.

## States
- Loading, empty, error, and offline states are designed.
